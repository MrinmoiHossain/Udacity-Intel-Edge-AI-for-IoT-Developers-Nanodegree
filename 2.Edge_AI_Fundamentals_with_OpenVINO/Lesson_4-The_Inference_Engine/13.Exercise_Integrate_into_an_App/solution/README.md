# Integrate the Inference Engine - Solution

Let's step through the tasks one by one, with a potential approach for each.

> Convert a bounding box model to an IR with the Model Optimizer.

I used the SSD Mobilenet V2 architecture from TensorFlow from the earlier lesson here. Note
that the original was downloaded in a separate workspace, so I needed to download it again
and then convert it.


```
wget http://download.tensorflow.org/models/object_detection/ssd_mobilenet_v2_coco_2018_03_29.tar.gz
tar -xvf ssd_mobilenet_v2_coco_2018_03_29.tar.gz 
cd ssd_mobilenet_v2_coco_2018_03_29
python /opt/intel/openvino/deployment_tools/model_optimizer/mo.py --input_model frozen_inference_graph.pb --tensorflow_object_detection_api_pipeline_config pipeline.config --reverse_input_channels --tensorflow_use_custom_operations_config /opt/intel/openvino/deployment_tools/model_optimizer/extensions/front/tf/ssd_v2_support.json
cp frozen_inference_graph.xml frozen_inference_graph.bin ../models/
```

> Extract the results from the inference request

```
self.exec_network.requests[0].outputs[self.output_blob]
```

> Add code to make the requests and feed back the results within the application

```
self.exec_network.start_async(request_id=0, inputs={self.input_blob: image})
...
status = self.exec_network.requests[0].wait(-1)
```

> Add a command line argument to allow for different confidence thresholds for the model

I chose to use `-ct` as the argument name here, and added it to the existing arguments.

```
optional.add_argument("-ct", help="The confidence threshold to use with the bounding boxes", default=0.5)
```

I set a default of 0.5, so it does not need to be input by the user every time. 

> Add a command line argument to allow for different bounding box colors for the output

Similarly, I added the `-c` argument for inputting a bounding box color.
Note that in my approach, I chose to only allow "RED", "GREEN" and "BLUE", which also
impacts what I'll do in the next step; there are many possible approaches here.

```
optional.add_argument("-c", help="The color of the bounding boxes to draw; RED, GREEN or BLUE", default='BLUE')
```

> Correctly utilize the command line arguments in #3 and #4 within the application

Both of these will come into play within the `draw_boxes` function. For the first, a new line
should be added before extracting the bounding box points that check whether `box[2]`
(e.g. the probability of a given box) is above `args.ct` - assuming you have added 
`args.ct` as an argument passed to the `draw_boxes` function. If not, the box
should not be drawn. Without this, any random box will be drawn, which could be a ton of
very unlikely bounding box detections.

The second is just a small adjustment to the `cv2.rectangle` function that draws the 
bounding boxes we found to be above `args.ct`. I actually added a function to match
the different potential colors up to their RGB values first, due to how I took them in from the
command line:

```
def convert_color(color_string):
    '''
    Get the BGR value of the desired bounding box color.
    Defaults to Blue if an invalid color is given.
    '''
    colors = {"BLUE": (255,0,0), "GREEN": (0,255,0), "RED": (0,0,255)}
    out_color = colors.get(color_string)
    if out_color:
        return out_color
    else:
        return colors['BLUE']
```

I can also add the tuple returned from this function as an additional `color` argument to feed to
`draw_boxes`.

Then, the line where the bounding boxes are drawn becomes:

```
cv2.rectangle(frame, (xmin, ymin), (xmax, ymax), color, 1)
```

I was able to run my app, if I was using the converted TF model from earlier (and placed in the 
current directory), using the below:

```bash
python app.py -m frozen_inference_graph.xml
```

Or, if I added additional customization with a confidence threshold of 0.6 and blue boxes:

```bash
python app.py -m frozen_inference_graph.xml -ct 0.6 -c BLUE
```

[Note that I placed my customized app actually in `app-custom.py`]
