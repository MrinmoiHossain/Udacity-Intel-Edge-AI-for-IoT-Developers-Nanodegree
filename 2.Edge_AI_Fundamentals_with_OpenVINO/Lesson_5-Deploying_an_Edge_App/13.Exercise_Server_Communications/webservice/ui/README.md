### Folder Structure
__components__  
> Small and highly reusable interface elements, these should rarely if ever be connected to redux.  

__constants__  
> Application constants for both js and css.  

__dux__  
> Short for redux in ducks style, there is generally one dux file per feature. Each dux file contains actions, action creators, and a reducer.  

__features__  
> Larger and more complex interface elements which generally do not get re-used. These will often be connected to redux via a Connected wrapper file.

__pages__  
> Entire application views which are rendered by the router.
