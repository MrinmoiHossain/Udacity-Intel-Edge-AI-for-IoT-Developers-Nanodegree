## Multithreading and Multiprocessing

Now we can return to our question from the previous page: Why do we want to have multiple cores on a single processor? The advantage of having multiple cores is that the CPU can execute multiple processes simultaneously. Put another way, having multiple cores enables the CPU to do multiprocessing.

**Multiprocessing is the act of executing multiple processes simultaneously.**

In addition to multiprocessing, you may have also heard the term multithreading. This is a very similar concept to multiprocessing.

**Multithreading is the act of executing multiple threads simultaneously.**
