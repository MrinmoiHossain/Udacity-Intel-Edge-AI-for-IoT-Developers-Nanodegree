## CPU
A CPU or Central Processing Unit is the electronic circuitry that executes the instructions of a computer program.

## Multiple Cores
A multicore processor is a computer chip that has multiple CPUs (called cores). Confusingly, a multicore processor is often simply called a "CPU", even though it contains multiple CPUs.

## Integrated GPU
An integrated GPU (IGPU) is a GPU that is located on a processor alongside the CPU cores and shares memory with them.
