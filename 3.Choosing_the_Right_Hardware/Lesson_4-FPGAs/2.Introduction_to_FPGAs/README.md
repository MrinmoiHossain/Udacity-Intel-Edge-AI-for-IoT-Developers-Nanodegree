## Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs)
Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) are chips that are hardwired during manufacturing in order to be optimally efficient for a specific need.

ASICs are often used in devices that have specific functions that aren't going to change over time. For example, you might want to create a circuit specifically for the backup camera in a line of cars. Developing this custom circuit is going to be very expensive, but the cost is offset by having an optimal circuit that can be used in a very large number of devices.

This is very different from an FPGA.

## Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs)
Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are chips designed with maximum flexibility, so that they can be reprogrammed as needed in the field (i.e., after manufacturing and deployment).
